# DSA_Practice

Welcome to my **Daily DSA Practice** repository! This repository is dedicated to my daily practice of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems. I am systematically working through the NeetCode series, a curated list of DSA problems that cover essential topics and patterns.

## üìö About the Repository

This repository is structured to showcase my daily progress in solving DSA problems. Each folder or file contains the solution to a specific problem, complete with explanations and insights into the approach taken. The problems are chosen to cover a wide range of topics, including but not limited to:

- Arrays and Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees and Graphs
- Dynamic Programming
- Recursion and Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms
- Sorting and Searching
- Graph Theory

## üîß Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Primarily Java, with some solutions in Scala.
- **Tools:** Git for version control, VSCode/IntelliJ for development, and Markdown for documentation.

## üóÇÔ∏è Repository Structure

- **/problems**: Contains subdirectories for each topic, with solutions to individual problems.
- **/NeetCode-Progress.md**: A tracker document to monitor my progress through the NeetCode series.
- **Links**: https://leetcode.com/u/Shubhang09/
